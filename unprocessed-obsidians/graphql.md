# GraphQL Vulnerabilities

## Shortcut

1.  Identify GraphQL Endpoint: Look for common paths like `/graphql`, `/graphiql`, `/graphql.php`, `/graphql/console`. Check network requests in browser developer tools.
2.  Introspection Query: Send an introspection query to fetch the schema. Tools like GraphiQL or Postman can help. `query={__schema{types{name}}}`
3.  Analyze Schema: Look for sensitive types, fields, mutations, and subscriptions. Pay attention to authorization logic.
4.  Test Queries/Mutations:
    - Check for Information Disclosure (e.g., user data, configuration).
    - Test for Authorization Bypass (IDOR, insufficient permission checks).
    - Look for Injection (SQLi, NoSQLi, Command Injection) in input fields.
    - Test for Denial of Service (complex/deeply nested queries, batching abuse).
    - Explore Mutations for unintended state changes.
    - Check Subscriptions for data leakage.
    - Verify persisted/signed queries enforced in production; depth/complexity limits.
5.  No Introspection? Try common field/type guessing (e.g., `user`, `admin`, `query`, `mutation`). Use tools like `clairvoyance` or `inql`.

## Mechanisms

- Over-Fetching: Clients can request excessive data, potentially leading to DoS or information disclosure if not properly limited.
- Under-Fetching/N+1 Problem: Primarily a performance issue—poorly designed resolvers make dozens of backend calls (N+1). While not a direct data‑exposure risk, extreme latency can create timing side‑channels an attacker could measure.
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR): Exposing internal IDs allows attackers to potentially access unauthorized data by guessing/enumerating IDs.
- Insufficient Authorization: Missing or flawed checks on types, fields, mutations, or subscriptions.
- Input Validation Issues: Failure to sanitize or validate user input can lead to injection attacks (SQLi, NoSQLi, XSS, SSRF) if resolvers interact with backend systems insecurely.
- Introspection Enabled in Production: Exposes the entire schema, simplifying reconnaissance for attackers.
- Batching Abuse: Sending multiple queries/mutations in a single request can overwhelm the server (DoS) or bypass rate limiting.
- Lack of Depth/Complexity Limiting: Allows excessively nested or complex queries, leading to DoS.
- Directive Flooding: Sending thousands of `@include`/`@skip` directives in a single query can exhaust parser and validation phases, triggering DoS (e.g., CVE‑2024‑47614 in async‑graphql).
- Incremental Delivery: `@defer`/`@stream` can multiply work and leak partial data; must be guarded by cost and auth checks on deferred subtrees.
- File Uploads: Implementations using `graphql-upload` or custom multipart handling can inherit classic upload bugs (path traversal, content-type trust, temp file exposure).
- Federation/Gateway: Cross-subgraph authorization gaps, entity resolver overfetching, and inconsistent role enforcement at the router vs. subgraphs.
- CSRF Considerations: If cookie‑based auth is used, enforce header + `Origin` validation; prefer Authorization header.
- WebSocket Security: GraphQL subscriptions over WebSocket often lack proper authorization on long-lived connections; auth tokens in connection params may not be re-validated after expiry.
- Field Suggestions: Error messages that suggest valid field names when invalid ones are queried can leak schema information even with introspection disabled.
- Relay Global IDs: Base64-encoded `Type:ID` patterns (e.g., `base64("User:123")`) are commonly used and can be decoded to reveal internal IDs.
- Apollo/Hasura Leaks: Production Apollo Server instances may leak schema via query extensions; Hasura permissions misconfiguration can expose direct DB access.
- Header Injection: `x-hasura-*` headers or custom auth headers may be trusted without validation, enabling privilege escalation.

## Hunt

### Preparation

- Identify the GraphQL endpoint(s).
- Obtain the schema via introspection or guessing.
- Understand the application context and potential sensitive data/actions.

### Techniques

- Schema Analysis: Use tools like `GraphQL Voyager` or manually review the schema for sensitive keywords (`admin`, `password`, `config`, `secret`), authorization directives, and complex relationships.
- Query Fuzzing: Use tools like `inql` or custom scripts to fuzz queries, mutations, and arguments.
- Authorization Testing:
  - Try accessing data/mutations meant for higher-privileged users.
  - Test IDOR by replacing IDs in queries/mutations.
  - Check if different roles see different schema subsets (if applicable).
  - Verify router and subgraphs enforce identical authz decisions.
- Injection Testing: Inject payloads (SQL, NoSQL, OS command, XSS, SSRF) into string arguments.
- DoS Testing:
  - Deeply nested queries (`query { user { friends { friends { ... } } } }`).
  - Large limits in list arguments (`query { users(limit: 99999) { id } }`).
  - Query batching abuse.
  - Field duplication/aliases (`query { u1: user(id:1){id} u2: user(id:1){id} ... }`).
  - Directive flooding by attaching a very long chain of `@include` or `@skip` directives to safe fields.
- Incremental delivery pressure: attach many `@defer`/`@stream` segments to expand compute and memory footprint.
- Business Logic Flaws: Test mutations for race conditions, logical errors, or unintended side effects.
- Upload testing: multipart spec edge cases (path traversal via `map`, temp file exposure) and file‑type checks.
- WebSocket Subscription Testing:
  - Tamper with `connection_init` payload (JWT in `connectionParams`)
  - Test subscription flooding without rate limiting
  - Verify auth token expiry is enforced on long-lived WS connections
  - Test for cross-user subscription leaks via predictable subscription IDs
- Field Suggestion Probing: Send invalid field names and analyze error messages for schema hints ("Did you mean...?" responses)
- Relay ID Decoding: Identify base64-encoded global IDs (e.g., `id: "VXNlcjoxMjM="`), decode to extract type and numeric ID, test IDOR
- Apollo Extensions: Try `?extensions={"persistedQuery":{...}}` or check for `apollo-server-testing` header in responses
- Hasura Header Injection: Test `x-hasura-role`, `x-hasura-user-id`, `x-hasura-org-id` headers for authorization bypass

### Advanced Testing

- Reverse engineer client-side code making GraphQL requests.
- Analyze traffic between microservices if GraphQL is used internally.
- Test subscription endpoints for authorization issues and data leakage over time.

## Bypass Techniques

### Introspection Disabled

Use wordlists (SecLists has GraphQL lists) with tools like `clairvoyance` or `GraphQLmap` to guess types, fields, and arguments. Analyze client-side code for hints.

- Quick probe: `query { __typename }` often succeeds even when full introspection is disabled and confirms a GraphQL endpoint.

- Use wordlists (SecLists has GraphQL lists) with tools like `clairvoyance` or `GraphQLmap` to guess types, fields, and arguments. Analyze client-side code for hints.

### Rate Limiting/Complexity Limits

- Use aliases to request the same field multiple times within limits.
- Split complex queries into multiple smaller ones.
- Abuse batching if not properly limited.

### Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)

- Use GraphQL query variations (aliases, fragments, different whitespace).
- Encode payloads within strings.
- Leverage nested input objects if WAF only inspects top-level arguments.
- Abuse incremental delivery: place sensitive fields under `@defer` to evade naive complexity calculators.
- Persisted queries reduce WAF reliance; prefer signature enforcement at edge.

## Vulnerabilities

### Common Patterns

- Publicly exposed GraphiQL interface with introspection enabled.
- Mutations lacking proper authorization checks.
- Resolvers directly using user input in database queries or system commands.
- Fields returning sensitive information not intended for the user's role.
- Lack of query depth/complexity/limit controls.

### Specific Functions/Areas:

- `user`, `account`, `profile` types/queries (Information Disclosure, IDOR).
- `admin`, `settings`, `config` types/queries (Privilege Escalation).
- Mutations involving payments, data modification, or user management.
- Search functionalities (Injection).
- File upload mechanisms via mutations.
- Subscription endpoints.

## Methodologies

### Systematic Process

1.  Reconnaissance (Endpoint discovery, Schema retrieval/guessing).
2.  Schema Analysis (Identify key types, fields, mutations, auth).
3.  Authorization Testing (Role-based access, IDOR).
4.  Input Vulnerability Testing (Injection, XSS, SSRF in arguments).
5.  DoS Testing (Query complexity, batching, limits).
6.  Business Logic Testing (Mutation side-effects, race conditions).
7.  Subscription Testing (if applicable).

### High-Impact Targets

Mutations changing state (user roles, passwords, settings), queries accessing sensitive user data, administrative endpoints.

## Chaining and Escalation

- **IDOR + Mutation**: Discover an IDOR in a query, then use the leaked ID to modify another user's data via a mutation (e.g., change email/password).
- **Information Disclosure + Injection**: Leak database structure/version via a verbose error, then use that info to craft a targeted SQLi payload.
- **SSRF + Internal Endpoint**: Use an SSRF vulnerability in a resolver to interact with internal GraphQL endpoints or other services not directly accessible.
- **Authorization Bypass + Admin Mutation**: Gain access to an administrative mutation (e.g., `updateUserRole`) through flawed authorization, then escalate privileges.
- **XSS + Token Theft**: Inject XSS payload via a vulnerable field, steal authentication tokens from other users viewing the data.

## Remediation Recommendations

- Disable Introspection in Production: Prevent easy schema discovery.
- Implement Strict Authorization: Apply checks at the schema level (directives) and within resolvers for every field, type, mutation, and subscription based on user roles/permissions. Use context passed to resolvers.
- Input Validation & Sanitization: Validate all arguments against expected types, formats, and lengths. Sanitize input before using it in downstream systems (databases, commands). Use parameterized queries.
- Query Cost Analysis: Implement limits on query depth, complexity (e.g., maximum nodes or calculated cost), and amount (limit number of results).
- Rate Limiting: Limit the number of requests per user/IP, including batched queries.
- Persisted & Signed Queries: Enforce automatic persisted queries (APQ) with operation signatures to whitelist allowed operations and block unknown or modified queries.
- Secure Federation Gateways: Keep Apollo Router (or your GraphQL gateway) patched, validate supergraph composition, and enforce authorization at the gateway layer to prevent cross‑subgraph data leaks.
- Caching & CDN Hardening: If responses are cached, partition caches by the `Authorization` header (or disable caching) to avoid shared‑cache data leakage.
- Specific Field Exposure: Avoid exposing sensitive fields (`password`, `internal tokens`). Use dedicated Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) if necessary.
- Error Handling: Return generic error messages; avoid leaking stack traces or internal details.
- Regular Audits & Testing: Perform regular security reviews and penetration tests specifically targeting the GraphQL API.
- Use Security Headers: Apply standard web security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.).
- Keep Libraries Updated: Ensure GraphQL server libraries and dependencies are patched.
- Incremental Delivery Controls: enforce cost accounting for `@defer`/`@stream`; ensure deferred subtrees still run full auth/visibility checks.
- File Upload Hygiene: if using GraphQL upload, re‑encode images, validate content by signature, and store outside web root; apply all controls from `file-upload.md`.
- Federation RBAC: centralize auth policy in schema directives evaluated at the gateway and in subgraphs; avoid trusting upstream filtering blindly.
