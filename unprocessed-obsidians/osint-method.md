  - [Fake Name Generator](https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/)
  - [This Person does not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)
  - Use separate browser profiles or isolation tools (e.g., **Firefox Multi‑Account Containers**) for any sock‑puppet activity.
  - Acquire disposable VoIP/SMS numbers (e.g., **Burner**, **Silent Link**) to satisfy platform verification without exposing real phone numbers.
  - Audit every browser extension before installation; supply‑chain attacks on popular add‑ons have targeted investigators since 2024.
  - Use dedicated browser profiles/containers per case and persona; avoid logging into personal accounts.
  - Prefer hardware‑backed passkeys for critical accounts; store recovery codes offline.
  - Maintain a minimal chain‑of‑custody: timestamp actions, hash key artifacts, and record tool versions per case.

## Cryptocurrency Investigation

### Transaction Analysis

- Track transaction flows between wallets
- Identify clusters of related addresses
- Monitor large transfers and whale activity
- Use block explorers to trace fund movements
- Tools:
  - Cielo: Multi-chain wallet tracking (EVM, Bitcoin, Solana, Tron)
  - TRM: Create relationship graphs for addresses/transactions
  - Arkham: Multichain explorer with entity labels, graph creation, and alerts
  - MetaSleuth: Transaction visualization for retail users
  - Range: CCTP bridge explorer
  - Socketscan: EVM bridge explorer
  - Pulsy: Bridge explorer aggregator
  - Chainalysis: **Horizon 2.0** cross‑chain tracing suite (paid)
  - Elliptic: **Lens** visual link explorer (launched Dec 2024)
  - Most compliance suites now provide **real‑time bridge‑risk scoring** dashboards (e.g., TRM, Chainalysis)

#### Layer 2 / Rollup Analysis

- **zkSync Era / Polygon zkEVM**: Zero-knowledge proofs hide transaction details on L2; only deposit/withdrawal bridge events visible on L1. Use [zkSync Era Block Explorer](https://explorer.zksync.io/) and [PolygonScan zkEVM](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/).
- **Arbitrum / Optimism**: Transactions batched and compressed; L2 state reconstructed from L1 calldata. Use [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/) and [Optimistic Etherscan](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/). Check [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/) for risk framework and technology stack.
- **StarkNet**: Cairo VM with STARK proofs; different address derivation. Use [Voyager](https://voyager.online/) or [StarkScan](https://starkscan.co/).
- **Base / Blast / Scroll**: OP Stack or ZK-rollups; similar challenges to above.
- **Privacy protocols on L2**:
  - Aztec Network: Programmable privacy with noir circuits; limited block explorer visibility.
  - Railgun: Privacy system for DeFi on Ethereum/Polygon/BSC; shielded pools obscure sender/receiver/amount.
  - Privacy Pools: Proposed Tornado Cash successor with association sets; not yet deployed at scale.
- **Challenges**:
  - Bridge mixers (Hop Protocol, Across, Stargate) create synthetic liquidity pools that break direct tracing; funds enter/exit via pool swaps.
  - Cross-rollup transfers further obfuscate trails; requires tracking via bridge contracts and relayer infrastructure.
  - Many L2s lack mature analytics tools; explorers show transactions but relationship graphs are sparse.
- **Methodology**:
  - Start with L1 bridge events (deposits/withdrawals); these anchor L2 activity to known addresses.
  - Use L2-specific explorers to trace activity within the rollup.
  - For privacy protocols, focus on timing analysis, deposit/withdrawal clustering, and off-chain metadata (transaction memos, Tornado Cash-style notes).

#### Cautions (bridges and heuristics)

- Bridges/mixers/wrappers introduce mint/burn semantics; avoid assuming 1:1 flows without on‑chain proofs.
- MEV/sandwich and aggregator paths can create false "direct" trails; validate with multiple datasets.
- Cross‑label sanity: vendor labels can disagree; treat labels as hypotheses, not ground truth.
- **L2 finality**: Optimistic rollups have 7-day challenge periods; zkRollups finalize faster but proofs can be batched/delayed.

  - Record coordinates in WKT and hash cached tilesets for reproducibility where feasible.

## Threat Actor Investigation

### Actor‑Centric Workflow

- Scoping
  - Define the actor hypothesis (e.g., APT28, APT29, Turla, Sandworm; APT10, APT41, Mustang Panda, Volt Typhoon).
  - Collect seed reports from CERTs and vendors; extract indicators and TTPs.
- Indicator harvesting
  - Parse IOCs (domains, IPs, hashes, JA3/JA4, user‑agents) from advisories and reports; normalize and de‑duplicate.
  - Validate IOCs with passive DNS, CT logs, sandbox submissions, and open telemetry where possible.
- Infrastructure mapping
  - Build pivots from CT logs (SANs, issuer, serials), shared hosting, name‑server reuse, registrar accounts, and HTML/page fingerprints.
  - Enrich with ASN/WHOIS history, RPKI/ROA status, geolocation, and hosting provider relationships.
- Artifact profiling
  - Extract PE/ELF metadata (PDB paths, compile timestamps, Rich headers, resources language, code‑signing certs).
  - Cluster with fuzzy hashes (SSDEEP/TLSH) and identify packers/loaders; search YARA and sandboxes for near‑matches.
- Social and procurement pivots
  - Pivot on developer handles, code snippets, academic theses, job posts, and procurement records that imply capability or mandate.
- Falsification and reporting
  - Weigh each linkage (weak/medium/strong); document alternatives; avoid single‑source attribution.
  - Map TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK and cite sources with exact sections/pages.

### Attribution Discipline

- Separate capability from intent and sponsorship; avoid mirror‑imaging.
- Use a rule‑of‑three: require at least three independent weak signals, or one strong + one weak, before asserting linkage.
- Prefer durable pivots (registrar accounts, code‑signing cert reuse, build path idioms) over ephemeral ones (resolving IPs).
- Clearly mark uncertainty levels and confidence (e.g., low/medium/high) and distinguish correlation from control.

### Russia‑Specific Pivots

- Corporate/people
  - EGRUL/EGRIP extracts (official registry; captcha‑gated) and Rusprofile/Kontur.Focus summaries for entities and directors.
  - Government procurement: `zakupki.gov.ru` (tenders, contractors), regional portals, and grant listings.
  - Job boards (e.g., `hh.ru`) for role requirements, tech stacks, and office locations.
- Infrastructure
  - RU WHOIS: `whois.tcinet.ru`; check registrar accounts, nserver patterns, and RU‑center usage.
  - Telegram is widely used; analyze channels, admins, cross‑posts, and bot ecosystems.
- Media/platforms
  - VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, Rutube, and regional news portals; search in Russian and transliterations.

### China‑Specific Pivots

- Corporate/people
  - National Enterprise Credit Info System (`gsxt.gov.cn`) for registered entities; cross‑check with Tianyancha/Qichacha (paid/freemium).
  - ICP filings (`beian.miit.gov.cn`) to link domains to legal entities via Unified Social Credit Codes (USCC).
- Infrastructure
  - CNNIC WHOIS and hosting footprints; common domestic clouds (Aliyun, Tencent Cloud, Huawei Cloud) and registrar patterns.
- Media/platforms
  - Weibo, WeChat Official Accounts (via `weixin.sogou.com`), Zhihu, Bilibili, Douyin, Xiaohongshu; search in Chinese and Pinyin.

### Infrastructure & Internet Measurement

- Map IPs to ASNs (HE BGP Toolkit, RIPEstat, BGPView); observe peering and hosting ecosystems.
- Check CT logs (crt.sh) for certificate reuse and issuance cadence; pivot on subjects/issuers/serials.
- Use URLScan and similar crawlers to capture HTML fingerprints, favicons (mmh3), and script hashes for clustering.
- Monitor DNS over time (SecurityTrails PDNS, DNSDB) for subdomain churn and staging domains.

- Dynamic/sandbox
  - Execute in sandboxes (ANY.RUN, Hybrid Analysis, CAPE, Tria.ge) to collect network IOCs, mutexes, file drops, and C2 patterns.
- Clustering
  - Use SSDEEP/TLSH and YARA matches to find related samples; compare config schemas and protocol quirks.
- Reporting
  - Normalize IOCs (STIX 2.1 if possible), include ATT&CK technique IDs, and provide reproduction steps.

### Telegram/WeChat Investigation
