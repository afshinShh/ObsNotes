# cause
## A relevant action

There is an action within the application that the attacker has a reason to induce. This might be a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">privileged action</mark> (such as modifying permissions for other users) or any action on <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">user-specific data</mark> (such as changing the user's own password).

## Cookie-based session handling

Performing the action involves issuing one or more HTTP requests, and the application <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">relies solely on session cookies to identify the user who has made the requests.</mark> There is no other mechanism in place for tracking sessions or validating user requests.

## No unpredictable request parameters

For example, when causing a user to change their password, the function is not vulnerable if an attacker needs to know the value of the existing password.

# vulnerable example
```http
POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 
Content-Length: 30 Cookie: 
session=yvthwsztyeQkAPzeQ5gHgTvlyxHfsAfE 

email=wiener@normal-user.com
```

This meets the conditions required for CSRF:

- The action of changing the email address on a user's account.
  
- The application uses a session cookie to identify which user issued the request. There are no other tokens or mechanisms in place to track user sessions.
  
- The attacker can easily determine the values of the request parameters that are needed to perform the action

you can exploit it using :

# defense

## CERF-token

### Criteria

1) Unpredictable with high <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">entropy</mark>, as for session tokens in general.
2) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Tied</mark> to the user's session.
3) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> Strictly validated </mark>in every case before the relevant action is executed.

### How should CSRF-tokens be generated?

1) You should use a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG)</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">seeded with the timestamp</mark> when it was created <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">plus a static secret. </mark>
2) you can generate individual tokens by concatenating its output with some user-specific entropy and take a strong hash of the whole structure.
---
### How should CSRF-tokens be transmitted?

##### hidden field of an HTML form that is submitted using the POST method 

``` html
< input type="hidden" name="csrf-token" value="CIwNZNlR4XbisJF39I8yWnWX9wX4WFoz" />
```
 + should be placed as early as possible (ideally before any non-hidden input field)
  
##### URL query string

is somewhat <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">less safe</mark> because the query string:
1) Is logged in various locations on the client and server side;
2) Is liable to be transmitted to third parties within the HTTP Referrer header
3) can be displayed on-screen within the user's browser.

##### costume request header
+ further defense against an attacker who manages to predict or capture another user's token, because browsers do not normally allow custom headers to be sent cross-domain
+ limits the application to making CSRF-protected requests using XHR (as opposed to HTML forms) and might be deemed over-complicated for many situations
+ CSRF tokens should not be transmitted within cookies


---
### How should CSRF tokens be validated?

- server-side 
- matches the value that was stored in the user's session
- regardless of HTTP method & content type of the request
- if there is no token the request should be rejected

---
## Strict SameSite cookies

explicitly setting <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">your own SameSite restrictions</mark> with each cookie you issue => you can control exactly which contexts the cookie will be used in, regardless of the browser
ideally, you should use the `Strict` policy by default, then lower this to `Lax` only if you have a good reason to do so.

## Be aware of cross-origin, same-site attacks

isolating insecure content 
- user-upload files on a separate site from any sensitive functionality or data
- sibling domains
