# My Obsidian Notes (aka ObsNotes)

Welcome to my Obsidian notes repository. I use this repo as a backup of my notes. knowledge is free and meant to be shared. feel free to dive in and use it however you like :)

## Usage

For the best experience, I recommend using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) software to import this repository as a vault. This will activate markdown options and internal links within the vault.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Obsidian.
3. Click on "Open folder as vault".
4. Navigate to the cloned repository and select it.

The configuration folder for the vault is available at [.obsidian].

## Markdown vs. Non-Markdown

The use of markdown significantly enhances the readability and navigation of the notes. Here's a comparison:
